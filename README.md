# GEES2Downloader
The GEES2Downloader, as its name suggests, is a simple downloader for S2 imagery from Google Earth Engine. 
The objective is to overcome the limitations imposed by GEE when downloading assets directly through HTTP protocol.

In these situations, the GEES2Downloader is able to subdivide the asset in smaller tiles and download them separately to recreate the original array (Figura 1).
The number of tiles is given automatically by the algorithm and the download occurs in parallel.
